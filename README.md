# Evaluating Fast Radiative Transfer Models Using Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer Slant Path Observations at Low Elevations

This repository contains the code and auxiliary material used in the study:  
**"Evaluating Fast Radiative Transfer Models Using Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer Slant Path Observations at Low Elevations and LBL Models: RTTOV-gb and ARMS-gb"**

## Motivation

Slant path microwave observations (4–30° elevation) from ground-based radiometers offer a unique opportunity to test the performance of both line-by-line (LBL) and fast radiative transfer (RT) models under non-zenith geometries. This study aims to:

- Evaluate biases and random errors in fast RT models such as **RTTOV-gb** and **ARMS-gb**.
- Benchmark against **line-by-line radiative transfer models**, especially for water vapor channels.
- The addition of simulated observations from modle Goemetry in ICON-D2 is planned.

## How to setup the Code:

1. Download RTTOV-gb code from here: https://nwp-saf.eumetsat.int/site/software/rttov-gb/.
2. Download git of pyrtlib: https://github.com/SatCloP/pyrtlib.
3. Install python packages from requirements.txt

## Scope of the Repository

This repository provides:

- Scripts to pre-process input from radiosondes and microwave radiometers.
- Interfaces for running:
  - **RTTOV-gb**
  - **ARMS-gb** (to be integrated)
  - **LBL models** (e.g. via mwrpy_ret or external)
- Tools for comparing modeled brightness temperatures with observations.
- Plotting and statistical analysis utilities.

## Data & Models Used

- Radiosonde measurements (compliation of the campaigns FESSTVaL, Socles and Vital I)
- Microwave radiometer TBs from azimuth scans, BL-scans and zenith for 5 HATPRO MWRs by RPG from these three campaigns)
- Model background or first guess fields will be added as inputs soon.
